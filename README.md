# Evil-Hangman
##### This game is similar to the traditional “Hangman” game, but it continuously pares down the word list to try to dodge the player's guesses as much as possible. This program was made as an opaque object and it uses a built in String object, a Generic Vector and a Binary Search tree in order read the dictionary and pares down the word list.
